    "We then check the row undernead (which again is mapped to an array that is +1 the size of the previous one) and we can keep track of the indicies directly orthogonal and underneath in virtue of the same array for every row. ***note*** in the future, one can use some math to pull the relevant numbers from the coming row but given the short memory space needed, we can do that later.\n",
