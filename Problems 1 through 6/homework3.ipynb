    "I had to decide whether I wanted to make a general solution, which involved taking the square root and checking every odd number between 2 and the sqrt(n), or a specific solution to this and I opted for a general solution, considering the general solution would only be marginally different.   The second big decision was how to optimize the instructions needed.  A key insight for ease of computation is to note that all primes > 3 are of the form 6n+1 or 6n-1.  The plan is to start generating primes (ideally we would just have a list of primes we could check against) by evaluating n as n increases. we would stop once a prime generated is >= the rough square of the number.
